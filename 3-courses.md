# CS 239 Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction
For graduate students

This studio-based course explores the field of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), covering its history, core concepts, and current research. Students will learn and apply the design process for creating interactive systems, including user research, needfinding, prototyping, and evaluation. With an emphasis on hands-on learning, the course is highly interactive, culminating in a project that students can complete individually or in small groups (strongly encouraged).
